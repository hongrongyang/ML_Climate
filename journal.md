# 🌍 Project Overview: Dynamic Price Incentive for EV Decarbonization Management in Distribution Network

Our project is to optimize dynamic price incentives for electric vehicle (EV) charging to simultaneously maximize social welfare, maintain grid safety, and manage carbon emissions. Building on a DRL-based pricing framework that models the price–demand relationship through EV user behavior at charging stations, the project extends the model by adding system carbon intensity as a new state variable and introducing penalty terms for carbon limit violations. The oringal framework that formulates the pricing problem as a limited Markov Decision Process (CMDP), capturing the implicit relationship between price and demand for charging of EVs through user decision modeling. To solve this, a safe deep reinforcement learning framework is proposed and the Adaptive Model Based Safe DRL (AMSDRL) algorithm is developed. The state variables in original framework only include the distribution of electric vehicles in the charging stations and the operational status of the grid.

To improve the environmental accountability and policy relevance of this framework, we extend the system by introducing a **carbon flow layer**. Specifically, we:

- Assign **carbon emission factors** to different energy sources (e.g., grid-supplied coal power, distributed solar);
- Model **carbon emissions at the node level**, tracking the CO₂ output associated with electricity procurement;
- Embed **carbon budgets or carbon pricing mechanisms** as either constraints or cost terms in the CMDP.

By integrating carbon-aware decision signals into the state, reward, and constraint space of the reinforcement learning controller, we aim to design a DRL-based policy that coordinates EV load, grid safety, and environmental sustainability in a holistic and scalable way.

The objective of this extension is to align the system with national and regional **carbon neutrality goals**, such as China's dual-carbon policy or emission trading systems (ETS) in the US and EU. However, to simplify verification, we impose a carbon intensity limit to constrain system emissions and evaluate whether the model performs effectively in the case study.


Sorry for the late update — our group officially resumed the project after the midterm, as the weeks leading up to spring break were quite busy. 

So Let's start with our project !!

#### 📅 Week 8 (2025.3.27)
After careful discussion and planning, we decided to **extend our project** by incorporating **additional carbon flow constraints** into the original EV–CS–DSO–Grid coupled optimization framework.

Our project builds upon Hongrong's previous work:  
 - **Dynamic Incentive Pricing on Charging Stations for Real-Time Congestion Management in Distribution Network**, which proposed a **dynamic incentive pricing strategy** to influence EV users to adjust their charging behavior in real time.

In this framework, the pricing problem is formulated as a **constrained Markov decision process (CMDP)** that integrates:
- Real-time EV behavior and user cost models;
- Grid-side physical constraints (power flow, voltage, current, congestion);
- Queueing, driving, and charging costs at charging stations.

A key aspect lies in the **Grid and DSO integration**:
- Charging stations report real-time load and status to the **Distribution System Operator (DSO)**;
- The DSO observes grid conditions and broadcasts **time-varying incentive prices** to affect EVs' decisions;
- Power flow equations (linearized SOCP) and operational constraints are embedded within the CMDP;
- The DSO aims to **maximize total social welfare**, balancing economic revenue, grid reliability, and service quality.

In the original paper, Hongrong develops a flow-based CMDP framework with multiple constraint formulations, including:

### 📅 Week 9 (2025.4.3)

##### ✅ Weekly Progress Update

This week, our main focus was on implementing the **carbon flow network** within the existing CMDP optimization framework.  
To improve the environmental sustainability and policy alignment of our original model—designed for EV load scheduling and distribution grid congestion management—we proposed an extension that incorporates **carbon emission modeling and constraints**.

The carbon intensity formulation aims to quantify how much carbon is emitted per unit of electricity (gCO₂/kWh) within a power distribution network.

- Equation (1): Total Injected Power: Calculates the total amount of electricity entering the system by summing the outputs of generators, static (renewable) sources, and external grid imports.

- Equation (2): Power Source Contribution Ratios: Determines how much each type of source (e.g., generator, solar, grid) contributes to the total power supply. These ratios are later used to weight carbon emissions.

- Equation (3): System-Wide Carbon Intensity: Computes the average carbon intensity of the system by combining each source's carbon footprint with its contribution ratio.

- Equation (4): Node-Level Assignment: Assumes the carbon intensity is uniformly spread across all buses (nodes) in the system. This simplifies the calculation by assigning the same carbon value to each node.

- Equation (5): Load-Weighted Carbon Intensity: Provides a refined system-wide carbon intensity that takes into account how much electricity is consumed at each node. Heavily loaded nodes have more influence on the average.

- Equation (6): Node-Specific Carbon Intensity: Further refines carbon intensity by considering how electricity from different sources is actually distributed to each node, using allocation factors.

### 🔄 Next Week Plan

Next week, we will focus on **integrating the carbon-aware mechanism with the DRL controller**, specifically:
- Expanding the state and reward space to include carbon cost and emission signals;
- Embedding carbon-aware safety constraints within the policy learning process;
- Evaluating trade-offs between economic efficiency and environmental impact via DRL simulations.


- Hongrong: Responsible for the derivation and explanation of the first four equations.
- Dongbing: Responsible for the last two equations and preparation of weekly project memos.

### 📅 Week 10 (2025.4.10)

##### ✅ Weekly Progress Update
This week, we focused on coupling the carbon intensity modeling with the DRL controller to enable environmentally aware policy learning. The goal was to ensure the pricing agent not only optimizes for user welfare and grid safety, but also respects system-wide carbon emission limits.

At a high level, enhancements includes:
- CMDP-Based Policy Learning: We formulated the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent maximizes long-term reward while satisfying safety constraints on system cost (e.g., carbon violations).

- Adaptive Cost Scaling: Introduced an ensemble-based uncertainty-aware cost function. The scaling factor `β` is adaptively tuned to balance safety and exploration during training.

- Extended State and Reward Design: equations to reflect the multi-objective nature of the system.
  - Reward `r_t` = scaled social welfare  
  - Cost `c_t` = carbon intensity cost `c_t^ci` + grid congestion cost `c_t^g`  

- Carbon Constraint Cost Term: Triggers penalty when the system-wide carbon intensity `CI_sw` exceeds the target limit `CI_max`. This ensures carbon emissions are constrained in the policy decisions.

- Grid Congestion Cost Term: Penalizes violations on key transmission lines if the power flow exceeds allowed thresholds `ϕ_max`. Prevents the model from creating congestion while rebalancing EV loads.

##### 🔄 Next Week Plan
Next week, we will begin full-scale integration and optimization of the **EV–CS–DSO–Grid–Carbon** system.  
The focus will shift to end-to-end coordination, global policy performance evaluation, and scenario-based analysis.

- Hongrong: Responsible for the first four enhanvements.
- Dongbing: Responsible for the last two enhanvements and preparation of weekly project memos.

### 📅 Week 11 (2025.4.17)

##### ✅ Weekly Progress Update

This week, we conducted additional research on **carbon trading mechanisms and regional carbon emission profiles**.  
Our focus included:
- Carbon emission factors for various energy sources, including coal, wind, and hydro power;
- Carbon trading market structures in **multiple Chinese cities**, as well as in **New York and California (USA)**.

We conduct our experiments on a machine with a 5.60 GHz CPU, NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, and 64 GB of RAM. The simulation environment integrates three core components: a real-world transportation network, a modified IEEE 33-bus power distribution system, and dynamic electric vehicle (EV) charging demand.

To better focus on carbon emission dynamics, we adopt a simplified network configuration. Specifically, we modify the standard IEEE 33-bus system by removing highly congested lines (e.g., 1–18, 9–10, and 27–28) and reducing topological complexity related to congestion.

Initial results from our integrated **EV–CS–DSO–Grid–Carbon** framework show that while the proposed method improves carbon-aware coordination, both the baseline and our method occasionally exceed the predefined carbon intensity limit.

##### 🔄 Next Week Plan

Next week, we will begin **full-scale integration and optimization** of the complete **EV–CS–DSO–Grid–Carbon** system.

We plan to focus on:
- End-to-end coordination of all modules;
- Global policy evaluation under different scenarios;
- Finalizing experimental design and running initial simulations.

We aim to complete most of the work by the end of the weekend and next week, and generate preliminary results for evaluation.
