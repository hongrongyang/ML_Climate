### üìÖ Week 8 (2025.3.27)

Sorry for the late update ‚Äî our group officially resumed the project after the midterm, as the weeks leading up to spring break were quite busy.

After careful discussion and planning, we decided to **extend our project** by incorporating **additional carbon flow constraints** into the original EV‚ÄìCS‚ÄìDSO‚ÄìGrid coupled optimization framework.

Our project builds upon Hongrong's previous work:  
 - **Dynamic Incentive Pricing on Charging Stations for Real-Time Congestion Management in Distribution Network**, which proposed a **dynamic incentive pricing strategy** to influence EV users to adjust their charging behavior in real time.

In this framework, the pricing problem is formulated as a **constrained Markov decision process (CMDP)** that integrates:
- Real-time EV behavior and user cost models;
- Grid-side physical constraints (power flow, voltage, current, congestion);
- Queueing, driving, and charging costs at charging stations.

A key aspect lies in the **Grid and DSO integration**:
- Charging stations report real-time load and status to the **Distribution System Operator (DSO)**;
- The DSO observes grid conditions and broadcasts **time-varying incentive prices** to affect EVs' decisions;
- Power flow equations (linearized SOCP) and operational constraints are embedded within the CMDP;
- The DSO aims to **maximize total social welfare**, balancing economic revenue, grid reliability, and service quality.

In the original paper, Hongrong develops a flow-based CMDP framework with multiple constraint formulations, including:

### ‚úÖ Weekly Progress Update

This week, we mainly focused on **reviewing the original implementation**, re-setting the environment, and understanding key constraints in the CMDP optimization model.

We did not add new modules, but we have begun preparing for next week‚Äôs extension:  
> Incorporating **carbon flow modeling and constraints** into the EV‚ÄìCS‚ÄìDSO‚ÄìGrid optimization architecture.

To support this, we surveyed related research in **carbon-aware power dispatch and optimization**.
