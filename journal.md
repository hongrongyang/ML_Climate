### üìÖ Week 8 (2025.3.27)

Sorry for the late update ‚Äî our group officially resumed the project after the midterm, as the weeks leading up to spring break were quite busy.

After careful discussion and planning, we decided to **extend our project** by incorporating **additional carbon flow constraints** into the original EV‚ÄìCS‚ÄìDSO‚ÄìGrid coupled optimization framework.

Our project builds upon Hongrong's previous work:  
 - **Dynamic Incentive Pricing on Charging Stations for Real-Time Congestion Management in Distribution Network**, which proposed a **dynamic incentive pricing strategy** to influence EV users to adjust their charging behavior in real time.

In this framework, the pricing problem is formulated as a **constrained Markov decision process (CMDP)** that integrates:
- Real-time EV behavior and user cost models;
- Grid-side physical constraints (power flow, voltage, current, congestion);
- Queueing, driving, and charging costs at charging stations.

A key aspect lies in the **Grid and DSO integration**:
- Charging stations report real-time load and status to the **Distribution System Operator (DSO)**;
- The DSO observes grid conditions and broadcasts **time-varying incentive prices** to affect EVs' decisions;
- Power flow equations (linearized SOCP) and operational constraints are embedded within the CMDP;
- The DSO aims to **maximize total social welfare**, balancing economic revenue, grid reliability, and service quality.

In the original paper, Hongrong develops a flow-based CMDP framework with multiple constraint formulations, including:

### ‚úÖ Weekly Progress Update

This week, we mainly focused on **reviewing the original implementation**, re-setting the environment, and understanding key constraints in the CMDP optimization model.

We did not add new modules, but we have begun preparing for next week‚Äôs extension:  
> Incorporating **carbon flow modeling and constraints** into the EV‚ÄìCS‚ÄìDSO‚ÄìGrid optimization architecture.

To support this, we surveyed related research in **carbon-aware power dispatch and optimization**.

### üìÖ Week 9 (2025.4.3)

### ‚úÖ Weekly Progress Update

This week, our main focus was on implementing the **carbon flow network** within the existing CMDP optimization framework.  
To improve the environmental sustainability and policy alignment of our original model‚Äîdesigned for EV load scheduling and distribution grid congestion management‚Äîwe proposed an extension that incorporates **carbon emission modeling and constraints**.

This enhancement supports national carbon neutrality targets (e.g., dual-carbon policy) and can align with external mechanisms such as **carbon trading markets (ETS)**.

### üîß Core Dimensions of the Proposed Extension

#### 1. Carbon Flow Modeling: Power ‚Üí Carbon
- Assign a **carbon intensity factor** to each type of electricity source (e.g., grid supply, distributed energy), denoted as \( \rho_{n,t}^{CO2} \), representing CO‚ÇÇ emissions per kWh.
- Introduce a **carbon budget variable** to dynamically track total emissions across buses and time periods.

#### 2. Carbon Budget Constraints & Cost Mechanisms
- Set a **global carbon constraint** (e.g., \( \sum CO_2 \leq \text{target}_t \)) to cap total emissions within the system.
- Alternatively, model emissions as a **penalty or tax term**, and embed it in the DSO or social welfare objective.
- Use a **shadow price of carbon** or ETS market price to represent marginal emission costs.

#### 3. Objective Function Enhancement: Economic + Environmental
- The original objective aimed to **maximize total social welfare**, combining: Charging station profitÔºåEV user benefit and DSO net profit 
- We now formulate a **multi-objective optimization**, adjusting the goal as:
  - `Maximized Objective = Social Welfare ‚Äì Carbon Cost √ó Total Emissions`

| Component                        | Description                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Carbon Factor Definition         | Assign emission factor \( \rho_{n,t}^{CO2} \) to each energy source (e.g., grid, distributed, zero-emission). |
| Node-Level Carbon Flow Modeling  | Calculate emissions at each bus based on power consumption and source-specific emission factors. |
| Carbon Budget Constraint         | Add a system-wide constraint on total emissions to stay within a predefined carbon cap.          |
| Objective Function Penalty Term  | Introduce carbon tax or shadow price into the objective to penalize emissions.                   |
| Multi-objective Formulation      | Expand original goal to balance social welfare and environmental sustainability.                 |

### üîÑ Next Week Plan

Next week, we will focus on **integrating the carbon-aware mechanism with the DRL controller**, specifically:
- Expanding the state and reward space to include carbon cost and emission signals;
- Embedding carbon-aware safety constraints within the policy learning process;
- Evaluating trade-offs between economic efficiency and environmental impact via DRL simulations.
