This project focuses on a pricing strategy for real-time electric vehicle (EV) charging management in distribution networks, aiming to maximize total social welfare while ensuring compliance with carbon intensity limits. The main challenges include defining and calculating carbon flow for charging stations and addressing the complex, time-varying relationship between pricing and charging demand within integrated power and transportation networks. To tackle these issues, we first model the EV user charging decision-making process to indirectly capture the unquantifiable price-demand relationship. We then formulate the pricing problem as a bi-level model using a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). To solve the CMDP problem, we propose a model-based safe deep reinforcement learning algorithm which learns the environment transition model using limited historical data, making it more practical for real-world applications. Numerical experiments on modified IEEE 33-bus combined with a transportation network using real-world EV data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
